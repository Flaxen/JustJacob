# JustJacob
As Flying Jakob wasn't able to fly, the project has now entered it's "Just Jakob" state. 

Just Jacob is a Senosrbased Labyrinth game for the Uno32 board with an I/O shield. The game has implementations for drawing custom maps and imorting them as well as a small animation library allowing tile based animations to take place on the small 128x32 display.

The only sensor used is a gyroscope which is a part of the added LSM6DS3 which also has an accelerometer amongst other sensors not yet implemented.

The project was made in about a week and was part of the IS1200 Computer Engineering course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
